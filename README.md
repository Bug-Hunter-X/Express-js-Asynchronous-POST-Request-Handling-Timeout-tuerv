# Express.js Asynchronous POST Request Handling Timeout

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations within a request handler can lead to client-side timeouts before the server sends a response.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/data` endpoint.  The server simulates asynchronous data processing using `setTimeout`.  If the processing time exceeds the client's timeout threshold (e.g., a few seconds), the client will receive a timeout error before receiving the server's response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version where asynchronous operations are handled appropriately, ensuring a prompt response to the client.
